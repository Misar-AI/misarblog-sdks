# Misar.Blog Kotlin SDK

Official Kotlin client for the Misar.Blog developer API. Coroutine-based, retry with back-off.

## Install

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("blog.misar:misarblog-sdk:1.1.0")
}
```

## Quick start

```kotlin
import blog.misar.sdk.MisarBlog
import blog.misar.sdk.PlanLimitException

val blog = MisarBlog("mbk_...")

val me = blog.account.me()
val thread = blog.comments.list("article-id", limit = 50)
val follows = blog.follows.status(me["id"] as String)

try {
    blog.ai.complete(mapOf("prompt" to "Draft an intro paragraph"))
} catch (e: PlanLimitException) {
    println("${e.plan} plan is out of credits — upgrade at ${e.upgradeUrl}")
}
```

## Authentication and plan gating

Every call goes through the metered gateway at `https://api.misar.io/blog/v1`
with your developer key as a Bearer token. Mint a key in the dashboard at
<https://www.misar.blog/dashboard/settings/api> — key management is a
cookie-session flow and is deliberately not exposed by this SDK.

Feature access and throughput follow the subscription attached to that key:

| Signal | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `401` | Missing, expired or revoked key |
| `403` | The key is scoped and lacks the scope this route needs |
| `429` (plain) | Rate limit — 100 requests/minute per key. The SDK retries with back-off |
| `429` + `plan_limit_exceeded` | A metered allowance is spent. Retrying will not help until it resets |
| `402` + `plan_limit_exceeded` | The feature is not on this plan |

The last two raise ``PlanLimitException`` rather than a generic error, carrying the
plan slug, the pricing URL and (when the API supplies it) seconds until reset.
Show the upgrade URL instead of reporting a bare failure — the SDK does not
retry these, because retrying cannot change the outcome.

## Covered operations

All 25 key-authenticated operations:

| Group | Operations |
| --- | --- |
| Articles | list, get, create, update, create draft, search, recommendations |
| Series | list, create, add article |
| Reactions | get, add, remove |
| Comments | list |
| Follows | status |
| AI | complete, titles |
| Images | generate, upload |
| Account | profile, plan, trial status, start trial |
| Analytics | summary, upsell funnel |

The API exposes no SSE or WebSocket endpoint that accepts an API key, so this
SDK is request/response only. See [`openapi/blog.openapi.json`][spec] for the
machine-readable contract.
